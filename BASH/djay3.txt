Douglas SweetingWIA With Eric SilvayJuly 31st 2014The company that I chose is my own personal site. It’s called The Opinion Point. This is a page dedicated to video games, anime, manga and cosplay.  The home page is the Index Page.  In the top left of the page there is the menu option.  This is hidden using one Jquery slider effect. When you hit the menu option the navigation bar comes out and allows you to traverse the web page. The links in order are* Home* Gallery* Video* Snake* Painting Pictures* #HumbleBragIf you click the home link, it brings you back to the home page. If you click on the Gallery Link, this brings you to a page with 4 pictures on this. I used Foundations version of light bock to make the pictures interactive. By clicking on a picture, a Lightbox gallery pops up which allows you to view a bigger picture and to also navigate through the picture. You also have the ability to exit out by clicking on the X in the top right of the screen.   The next link is Video. This video is a intro video I created for my site.  This video is playable on all the different web browers by utilizing the mp4, ogv, and webm file types.  The next link is Snake, which is a game using canvas. You can control the snake by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.  The next link is another utilization of canvas. You can draw on the page. At the bottom of the page you can change the thickness of the lines and even the color, when you are done there is a clear button that you can click which will rest the page.   The last page is #humblebrag which is a spin of the animated Bar Chart that we learned in class.  Also, there is a show hide button which is my second user interactive button to be able to show the data or hide it at the top of the screen.
